## Introduction
In this Portfolio document, I would like to share my work details on the projects I have worked and have been working on data analytics. This project aims to leverage data-driven insights and advanced analytics techniques to solve real-world problems and drive meaningful impact. Below, I outline the key details and objectives of my projects.

## Projects Description

**Project1 - Supply chain Master data analysis and reporting**

[Project1: Micron Technology](https://www.micron.com/about/our-commitment/sourcing-responsibly/supply-chain)

- Extracting data from various sources and performing ETL Process to load the data on to SQL Server
- With the data on SQL Server helped cross functional teams to do data manupulations and transformations to generate results.
- Managed and maintained production data on supply chain domain and helped to build a data pipelines for reporting.
- Visualized the data on Tableau in intuitive and interactive ways to help end users understand the statistics of data and make decisions.

**Project2 - Reporting solutions in Live data for Coral Reef bleaching issue**

[Project2: CIS_671](https://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/satellite/research/coral_bleaching_report.php)

- Extracting data from excel public source and performing ETL Process to load the data on to SQL Server
- With the data on SQL Server helped cross functional teams to transform the data using SQL and did data manupulations.
- Developed the graphs on Tableau that would predict the trends and behavious of corals location wise.
- Identified the factors like High heat, climatic conditions influencing the corals getting more bleached and provided the statistics.
- Visualized the data on Tableau in intuitive and interactive ways to help end users understand the statistics of data and make decisions.


**Project3 - Database management solutions for GVSU Science-Inventory management data**

[Project3: GVSU_CSIMS](https://www.gvsu.edu/clas/labresource/chemical-and-supply-information-management-system-70-60.htm)

- Worked on the Filemaker pro (Claris) tool to maintain and manage the database for the inventory system in GVSU.
- Created filemaker objects and layouts for the end users and created interactive applets, UI on filemaker with backened database design and  modeling the schema.
- Organized and managed the database structures and handled the documentations.

# Current Project in my Internship ~ Dream Job

**Project4: Data analytics and Reporting solutions to Marmon Food Service & Technologies**

[Project4: FoodService production data](https://www.marmon.com/business-groups/foodservice-technologies/)

- Creating Adhoc reports and developing reporting solutions using analytical tools like SQL Server and PowerBI.
- Data Organizing and collection / extraction of data from LN Infor site and performing data transformations on sql server.
- Creating models for predicting factors impacting in supply chain and by visualizing results explaining the statistics of data.'
- Database management and developing reporting solutions to the end user or clients.

## Work FLow I follow for the Projects:

The primary objectives of my projects are as follows:

1. **Data Collection**: TO gather relevant data from various sources, ensuring its quality and integrity.

2. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**: To Perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data. Clean, transform, and preprocess the data as needed to ensure its suitability for analysis.

3. **Feature Engineering**: New featuring to enhance the predictive power of the models.

4. **Model Development**: To develop robust and accurate predictive models using suitable machine learning or statistical techniques.

5. **Model Evaluation and Selection**: Evaluating the performance of different models and select the most appropriate one based on predefined criteria.
6. **Insights and Recommendations**: Derive actionable insights from the data analysis results and provide recommendations to address the problem or optimize the desired outcomes.
7. **Visualization and Reporting**: Creating visually appealing and informative visualizations to effectively communicate the findings and insights to stakeholders.

## Tools and Technologies

To accomplish all the projects mentioned above, I utilize the following tools and technologies:

- Programming Languages: [Python, SQL]
- Data Analysis and Machine Learning Libraries: [Pandas, NumPy]
- Data Visualization Tools: [Tableau, PowerBi]
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE): [IDLE Python, PyCharm]
- Analytical Tools and softwares: [SQL Server, SSIS, InforLN, SAP HANA, Snowflake Cloud, Filemaker]
- Data Storage and Manipulation: [SQL, CSV, EXCELs, Sharepoint, Snowflake Cloud, Azure Data storage]
- Collaboration and Version Control: [JIRA, ServiceNow, GitHub, Git]

## Expected Impact

- **Improved Decision-Making**: The insights gained from data analytics will enable more informed and data-driven decision-making processes.

- **Efficiency and Optimization**: By identifying inefficiencies and bottlenecks, the project will drive optimization and process improvements.

- **Predictive Capabilities**: The developed predictive models will aid in forecasting future trends, enabling proactive measures to be taken.

- **Competitive Advantage**: Leveraging data analytics will provide a competitive edge, helping to differentiate and excel in the chosen domain.



# The Data solution I would like to work further for a competition is : 

[Predict H1N1 and Seasonal Flu Vaccines](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/66/flu-shot-learning/)

- I had a over view of this scenario and like to work on a solution for this competition
- The key elements I analyzed are:
- Using a Machine learning approach we can provide a solution to this scarenio like :
- Creating a Model after data collection, pre processing and featuring selection of most impacting factors in prediction.
- **An efficient approach would be creating a ML Model like "Logistic Regression" can predict the results.**

### Data Manipulation

1. **Create a Vector**: `x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)`
2. **Access Elements in a Vector**: `x[3]` (accesses the third element)
3. **Create a Matrix**: `m <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)`
4. **Access Elements in a Matrix**: `m[2, 3]` (accesses the element in the second row and third column)
5. **Create a Data Frame**: `df <- data.frame(x = c(1, 2, 3), y = c("a", "b", "c"))`
6. **Access Columns in a Data Frame**: `df$x` or `df[["x"]]`

### Data Analysis

1. **Summary Statistics**: `summary(x)` (provides summary statistics of a numeric vector)
2. **Calculate Mean**: `mean(x)`
3. **Calculate Standard Deviation**: `sd(x)`
4. **Calculate Correlation**: `cor(x, y)`
5. **Perform t-test**: `t.test(x, y)`
6. **Perform Chi-squared Test**: `chisq.test(x, y)`
