The **MTA Data Challenge** is a project focused on analyzing public transit data from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) to uncover ridership patterns and provide actionable insights through reports and visualizations.

**Key Highlights**:
- Processed and cleaned large datasets with millions of rows from MTA's subway turnstile data.
- Developed interactive visualizations to track station activity, peak ridership times, and entry/exit patterns.
- Created reports on ridership trends to help transit authorities optimize resource allocation.

**Tools Used**: Python, SQLite, Gen AI, Excel, Power BI, Jupyter Notebooks

Project Title: Analyzing Gender Bias in Tech Layoffs: A Data-Driven Approach
Project Description:
Goal: To analyze data from various sources to understand the gender disparity in tech layoffs, specifically focusing on the following:
Gender distribution in tech layoffs
Comparison of earnings losses for women and men
Number of laid-off employees who found new jobs between men and women
Methodology:

- Data Collection: Identified and gathered relevant data from multiple online sources (articles, reports, websites) related to tech layoffs     and gender bias.
- Data Analysis: Extracted key data points from the sources, including percentages, ratios, and trends.
- Visualizations: Created simple visualizations (bar charts) to present the key findings and highlight the discrepancies.

Key Findings: Women are disproportionately represented in tech layoffs.
Women experience significantly higher earnings losses than men following layoffs.
While the difference in finding new jobs may be smaller, the combination of higher layoff rates and greater earnings losses for women creates a significant disadvantage.

Impact:
The findings highlight the need for greater awareness of gender bias in tech layoffs and the importance of addressing these issues.
This project provides a foundation for further research and could contribute to initiatives aimed at promoting gender equity in the tech industry.

Technical Keypoints:
- Web Scraping: Used programming skills (likely Python) and libraries like BeautifulSoup to extract data from websites.
- Data Analysis: Processed and analyzed the collected data to identify key trends and patterns.
- Data Visualization: Created simple graphs (bar charts) to communicate the findings effectively.
