# The Data solution I would like to work further for a competition is : 

[Predict H1N1 and Seasonal Flu Vaccines](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/66/flu-shot-learning/)

- I had a over view of this scenario and like to work on a solution for this competition
- The key elements I analyzed are:
- Using a Machine learning approach we can provide a solution to this scarenio like :
- Creating a Model after data collection, pre processing and featuring selection of most impacting factors in prediction.
- **An efficient approach would be creating a ML Model like "Logistic Regression" can predict the results.**

### Data Manipulation

1. **Create a Vector**: `x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)`
2. **Access Elements in a Vector**: `x[3]` (accesses the third element)
3. **Create a Matrix**: `m <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)`
4. **Access Elements in a Matrix**: `m[2, 3]` (accesses the element in the second row and third column)
5. **Create a Data Frame**: `df <- data.frame(x = c(1, 2, 3), y = c("a", "b", "c"))`
6. **Access Columns in a Data Frame**: `df$x` or `df[["x"]]`

### Data Analysis

1. **Summary Statistics**: `summary(x)` (provides summary statistics of a numeric vector)
2. **Calculate Mean**: `mean(x)`
3. **Calculate Standard Deviation**: `sd(x)`
4. **Calculate Correlation**: `cor(x, y)`
5. **Perform t-test**: `t.test(x, y)`
6. **Perform Chi-squared Test**: `chisq.test(x, y)`
